# Patha_Generator_Script
Generates Patha ( eg krama patha , ghana patha .. ) for the seperated audio files . This is useful in memorizing


Place Beep.mp3 in folder above the script 

The only script require is 
pata_script.rb (it is a combined script to generate all the Pathas )

The script should be placed in the seperated audio files in a folder,
Their should not be any files except seperated files. 
The seperated files should be numbered files ( e.g. 1.mp3 2.mp3 3.mp3 ... )


The result files will be in the folder above the seperated audio files folder.
